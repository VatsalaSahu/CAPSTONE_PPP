The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was established  to help small businesses. The Paycheck Protection Program allows entities to apply for low-interest private loans to pay for their payroll. Predicting the correct loan approval amount would help the entities in receiving a correct amount of loan.

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan is a type of loan established by the US Small Business Administration (SBA) as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the PPP loan is to help small businesses keep their workers on the payroll during the pandemic. The PPP loans are made through SBA-approved lenders and are fully guaranteed by the federal government.
The aim of the program is to help these businesses keep their employees on the payroll, cover eligible expenses such as rent, mortgage interest, and utilities, and keep their operations running during the crisis.
By providing PPP loans to eligible small businesses, the federal government  aims to prevent widespread layoffs, preserve jobs, and support the economy during a time of crisis.
In addition to helping businesses stay afloat, the PPP loan also offers the potential for loan forgiveness if certain conditions are met. This provides an added incentive for small businesses to participate in the program and helps ensure that the funds are being used effectively.

PROBLEM_STATEMENT::Predict the PPP currently approved loan amount for the Small Businesses.

OBJECTIVE:: The objective is to develop a predictive regression model for PPP current approved loan amount.
The model will consider essential borrower’s and lender’s characteristics.
The goal is to help lenders make informed decisions and distribute funds efficiently.
The pandemic's impact on small businesses is a key consideration.


The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was established  to help small businesses, self-employed workers, nonprofit organizations, and tribal businesses to continue paying their workers. The Paycheck Protection Program allows entities to apply for low-interest private loans to pay for their payroll and certain other costs. Predicting the correct loan approval amount would help the entities in receiving a correct amount of loan so that the business stays afloat.

The Paycheck Protection Program ’s real objective would be fulfilled only if the small businesses facing actual problems would get the efficient amount of funding to keep them afloat. Therefore predicting the correct amount of Loan would help the US Government  to help the businesses in the most effective way possible.
